Tips for equalization. By frequency, by instrument with a glossary.
This article will still get updated. (Last update: `Thursday, April 20th 2017`)

#### EQ Frequency Breakdown
<ul>
	<li><b>30Hz</b> / Virtually undetectable, you can safely cut these frequencies.</li>
	<li><b>40-60Hz</b> / Sub bass Freque­ncies. "Feel" only.</li>
	<li><b>60-200Hz</b> / Add for tom "boom". Cut to decrease bass "boom".</li>
	<li><b>80Hz</b> / Boost for the kick drum lower end to cut through the mix. Notch most other instruments here. Rolling off the electric guitar here is advisables.</li>
	<li><b>80-200Hz</b> / Boost bass instruments for presence. Boost will add warmth and fullness to guitars, vocals and horns.</li>
	<li><b>100Hz-4kHz</b> / Scooping/notching instruments here will provide room in the mix.</li>
	<li><b><=120Hz</b> / Add for warmth. Too much will sound muddy.</li>
	<li><b>120-125Hz</b> / Top of the range for most subwoofers. Also the low end of music such as kick drums and bass guitar. Bottom end of acoustic guitar and piano. Add for warmth.</li>
	<li><b>120-600Hz</b> / Boost for strong vocal presence. Causes problems with vocal resonance and fatiguing.</li>
	<li><b>200Hz</b> / Slight boost for depth. Cut to reduce muddiness. This is a good area to get the "gong" out of cymbals.</li>
	<li><b>240Hz</b> / Boost to fatten the snare. Boost acoustic guitars slightly to add fullness. Scoop vocal here if muddy. Notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum.</li>
	<li><b>350-400Hz</b> / Cut to remove the "cardboard" sound of drums - Notch the bass guitar a little bit to reduce presence.</li>
	<li><b>0.6-3kHz</b> / Provides presence, but are hard in nature. Good for rock.</li>
	<li><b>800Hz</b> / Boost the bass guitar for punch. Cut the electric guitar to remove the "cheap" sound.</li>
	<li><b>2-4kHz</b> / In this area you can emphasize the "smack" of the kick's beater.</li>
	<li><b>2.5kHz</b> / Good for adding to a dirty guitar for some real sizzle. Boost this area for bass guitar if using the pop/slap style.</li>
	<li><b>2.5-5kHz</b> / Boost for clarity with an acoustic guitar and piano.</li>
	<li><b>3-7kHz</b> / This is the area where vocal sibilance resides. Boost slightly to add sense of "volume" It also adds a harshness that is partic­ularly fatiguing. Add warmth without loss of clarity by attenu­ating this region a bit.</li>
	<li><b>4kHz</b> / Boost vocal here for presence.</li>
	<li><b>4-9kHz</b> / Bright­ness, presence, defini­tion, sibilance, high frequency distortion.</li>
	<li><b>4.5kHz</b> / Extremely tiring to the ears, add a slight notch here.</li>
	<li><b>5kHz</b> / Add a crisp, sharp "­cra­ck" to the snare. Also a good place to add some attack to the toms. Cut on background parts to make them sink in to the back a bit.</li>
	<li><b>>=7kHz</b> / Add for the sense of quality and accuracy for cymbals. Too much output will come off as lacking defini­tion. Cut vocals to decrease sibilance.</li>
	<li><b>8-12kHz</b> / Cut or Boost to adjust brightness for cymbals and acoustic guitar.</li>
	<li><b>9-15kHz</b> / Adding will give sparkle, shimmer, bring out details. Cutting will smooth out harshness and darken the mix.</li>
	<li><b>10kHz</b> / Boost to add "­air­" and clarity to acoustic instru­ments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li><b>Vocals</b> / presence (5 kHz), sibilance (7.5 ‐ 10 kHz), boom (200 ‐ 240 kHz), fullness (120 Hz)</li>
	<li><b>Electric Guitar</b> / fullness (240 Hz), bite (2.5 kHz), air / sizzle (8 kHz)</li>
	<li><b>Bass Guitar</b> / bottom (60 ‐ 80 Hz), attack (700 ‐ 1000 Hz), string noise (2.5 kHz)</li>
	<li><b>Snare Drum</b> / fatness (240 Hz), crispness (5 kHz)</li>
	<li><b>Kick Drum</b> / bottom (60 ‐ 80 Hz), slap (4 kHz)</li>
	<li><b>Hi Hat & Cymbals</b> / sizzle (7.5 ‐ 10 kHz), clank (200 Hz)</li>
	<li><b>Toms<b> / attack (5 kHz), fullness (120 ‐ 240 Hz)</li>
	<li><b>Acoustic Guitar</b> / harshness / bite (2 kHz), boom (120 ‐ 200 Hz), cut (7 ‐ 10 kHz)</li>
</ul>

#### EQ Glosary
<ul>
	<li><b>Attenuation</b> / the reduction of a signal level</li>
	<li><b>Band</b> / range of frequencies</li>
	<li><b>Boost</b> / selected frequency levels are amplified</li>
	<li><b>Cut</b> / selected frequency are attenuated</li>
	<li><b>Presence</b> / increasing causes the sounds of voices and such instruments seem more "present"</li>
	<li><b>Q</b> / describes the shape of the EQ curve (higher Q = narrower range, lower Q = wider range)</li>
	<li><b>Sibilance</b> / refers to the hissing "s","sh","z", or "zh", sound of the human voice</li>
	<li><b>Warmth</b> / sound where the bass and low mid frequencies have depth and where the high frequencies are smooth sounding opposed to aggressive or fatiguing</li>
</ul>

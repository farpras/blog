    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><= 30Hz</td>
            <td>Virtually undetectable, you can safely cut these frequencies</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>40-60Hz</td>
            <td>Sub bass FrequeÂ­ncies. "Feel" only</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>60-200Hz</td>
            <td>Add for tom "boom". Cut to decrease bass "boom"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>80Hz</td>
            <td>Boost for the kick drum lower end to cut through the mix. Notch most other instruments here. Rolling off the electric guitar here is advisables</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>80-200Hz</td>
            <td>Boost bass instruments for presence. Boost will add warmth and fullness to guitars, vocals and horns</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>100Hz-4kHz</td>
            <td>Scooping/notching instruments here will provide room in the mix</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><=120Hz</td>
            <td>Add for warmth. Too much will sound muddy</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>120-125Hz</td>
            <td>Top of the range for most subwoofers. Also the low end of music such as kick drums and bass guitar. Bottom end of acoustic guitar and piano. Add for warmth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>120-600Hz</td>
            <td>Boost for strong vocal presence. Causes problems with vocal resonance and fatiguing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>200Hz</td>
            <td>Slight boost for depth. Cut to reduce muddiness. This is a good area to get the "gong" out of cymbals.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>240Hz</td>
            <td>Boost to fatten the snare. Boost acoustic guitars slightly to add fullness. Scoop vocal here if muddy. Notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>350-400Hz</td>
            <td>Cut to remove the "cardboard" sound of drums - Notch the bass guitar a little bit to reduce presence</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0.6-3kHz</td>
            <td>Provides presence, but are hard in nature. Good for rock.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>800Hz</td>
            <td>Boost the bass guitar for punch. Cut the electric guitar to remove the "cheap" sound</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2-4kHz</td>
            <td>In this area you can emphasize the "smack" of the kick's beater</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.5kHz</td>
            <td>Good for adding to a dirty guitar for some real sizzle. Boost this area for bass guitar if using the pop/slap style</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.5-5kHz</td>
            <td>Boost for clarity with an acoustic guitar and piano</td>

### EQ Freq Breakdown

**30Hz** / Virtually undetectable, you can safely cut these frequencies
**40-60Hz** / Sub bass FrequeÂ­ncies. "Feel" only
**60-200Hz** / Add for tom "boom". Cut to decrease bass "boom"
**80Hz** / Boost for the kick drum lower end to cut through the mix. Notch most other instruments here. Rolling off the electric guitar here is advisables
**80-200Hz** / Boost bass instruments for presence. Boost will add warmth and fullness to guitars, vocals and horns
**100Hz-4kHz** / Scooping/notching instruments here will provide room in the mix
**<=120Hz** / Add for warmth. Too much will sound muddy
**120-125Hz** / Top of the range for most subwoofers. Also the low end of music such as kick drums and bass guitar. Bottom end of acoustic guitar and piano. Add for warmth
**120-600Hz** / Boost for strong vocal presence. Causes problems with vocal resonance and fatiguing
**200Hz** / Slight boost for depth. Cut to reduce muddiness. This is a good area to get the "gong" out of cymbals.
**240Hz** / Boost to fatten the snare. Boost acoustic guitars slightly to add fullness. Scoop vocal here if muddy. Notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum
**350-400Hz** / Cut to remove the "cardboard" sound of drums - Notch the bass guitar a little bit to reduce presence
**0.6-3kHz** / Provides presence, but are hard in nature. Good for rock.
**800Hz** / Boost the bass guitar for punch. Cut the electric guitar to remove the "cheap" sound
**2-4kHz** / In this area you can emphasize the "smack" of the kick's beater
**2.5kHz** / Good for adding to a dirty guitar for some real sizzle. Boost this area for bass guitar if using the pop/slap style
**2.5-5kHz** / Boost for clarity with an acoustic guitar and piano

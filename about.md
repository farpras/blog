Hello, my name is Farpras. Not a real name, cause why should I? :D
This is a blog based on Jekyll. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/farpras/blog">here</a>. I will post anything about my stuffs. Such as music, tips, tutorial, and others.

Making music is my hobby and passion since graduated from high school in 2014. Mostly, I'm making instrumental cover and remix of Anime soundtracks on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/farpras">YouTube channel</a>. Beside of music producing, I also really like programming. Currently I self learning some programming language like JavaScript, PHP, Python, C#, and also Java in the college.
